# Natural no.
 The natural numbers are the numbers that include all the positive integers from 1 to infinity. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ......, n. When we add these numbers together, we get the sum of natural numbers.


 In this section, we will create the following programs:

 Java program to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers
 Java program to find the sum of n natural numbers
 Java program to find the sum of n natural numbers using the function
 We can also find the sum of n natural number using the mathematical formula:

 Sum of n natural numbers=n*(n+1)/2
 Suppose, we want to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. By putting the value in the above formula, we get:

 Java Program to Find Sum of Natural Numbers
 In this section, we are going to use the following ways to find the sum of natural numbers.

1-> Using Java for Loop
2-> Using Java while Loop
3-> Using Function
